## What is this?

`claude-bughunter` is a drop-in skill bundle for the [Claude Code skills system](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). Install once and Claude Code stops being a chatbot and starts behaving like a senior bug-hunting researcher or red-team operator: it knows the techniques, the chain templates, the VRT mappings, the platform CVE chains, and the hygiene — and it stays in scope.

Four layers stack:

- **Think** — `bb-methodology` + `redteam-mindset`: the 5-phase non-linear workflow, critical-thinking framework, and red-team operator discipline.
- **Hunt webapps** — 48 `hunt-*` skills curated from 681 disclosed HackerOne reports: per-class detection patterns, payloads, bypass tables, and chain templates.
- **Hit the perimeter** — enterprise platform chains (M365/Entra, Okta, vCenter, SSL-VPN appliances, SharePoint, cloud IAM): current 2024–2026 CVE chains + post-credential escalation.
- **Ship it** — `triage-validation` + reporting + `evidence-hygiene`: the 7-Question Gate, VRT-aware severity, OOS rebuttals, PII redaction, and red-team deliverables.

All triggered automatically by topic — describe what you're testing in plain English and the relevant skill loads. No invocation by name.

---

## Quickstart

**Option A — install as a Claude Code plugin (recommended).** From inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter
/plugin install claude-bughunter@elementalsouls
```

All 71 skills + 15 commands load namespaced under `claude-bughunter:` and update when you bump the plugin version — no files copied into `~/.claude/`.

**Option B — copy install (no plugin system / pin to a clone):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter.git
cd Claude-BugHunter
bash scripts/install.sh        # copies skills + commands into ~/.claude/
```

That's it. Open Claude Code and describe what you're testing in plain English — the right skill loads automatically, no invocation by name:

```text
> Testing acme.com — an in-scope HackerOne target. Run recon and rank the surface.

  ⟳ loading skills: web2-recon, offensive-osint, bb-methodology …
    → subdomain enum (subfinder + crt.sh) … 47 hosts
    → live hosts (httpx) … 12 · tech fingerprint … 6 distinct stacks
    → ranked surface: api.acme.com (GraphQL, introspection ON)  ← start here
                      auth.acme.com (OAuth, SSO)               ← hunt-oauth

  Next: want me to probe the GraphQL introspection + OAuth redirect_uri?
```

→ Full [Installation guide](INSTALL.md) · [Usage guide](USAGE.md) · [searchable skill catalog](docs/skills.md).

## Runs on four harnesses

![One install, four agent harnesses — Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Hermes Agent](assets/harness-routing.svg)

The skills are plain [Agent Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) — the same `SKILL.md` format that **Claude Code · OpenCode · OpenAI Codex CLI · Hermes Agent** all load. One command installs them everywhere:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --all --burp-mcp
```

`--all` copies the skills to every harness's path (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.hermes/skills`); `--burp-mcp` wires the Burp MCP server into each. The full *knowledge* layer ports to all four — the slash commands and `/hunt` engine stay Claude-Code-only by design.

## Scope — what this bundle is for, and what it isn't

This bundle covers the **external attack surface** — anything reachable from the internet without first compromising an internal endpoint.

### In scope

- **Bug bounty hunting** — web apps, APIs, SaaS, GraphQL, OAuth, JWT, file upload, IDOR, SSRF, RCE chains
- **Web application pentesting** — full hunt-* coverage of OWASP-mapped bug classes + discipline rules
- **External red-team engagements** — initial-access against internet-facing enterprise estate: M365 / Entra ID, Okta-as-IdP, SharePoint on-prem (ToolShell + legacy SOAP), VMware vCenter / Workspace ONE, SSL VPN appliances (Cisco / Fortinet / Citrix / Palo Alto / Pulse / SonicWall / F5), Android APK red-team, supply-chain recon
- **Cloud misconfig + post-credential escalation** — public S3, IMDS chains, STS AssumeRole, cross-account confused-deputy
- **Recon + OSINT** — subdomain enum, identity-fabric mapping, certificate transparency, JS analysis, secret scanning
- **Reporting** — H1, Bugcrowd (VRT-aware), Intigriti, Immunefi, plus client-facing red-team deliverable format

### Out of scope (deliberate — not gaps, design decisions)

- **Internal Active Directory attacks** — BloodHound, Kerberoasting, ASREProast, DCSync, Pass-the-Hash, AD CS abuse, ntlmrelayx, Responder, PetitPotam, etc. Different operational risk profile; needs different tooling and judgment. **Future bundle, not this one.**
- **C2 frameworks** — Cobalt Strike, Sliver, Mythic, Havoc, BRC4 tradecraft. Out of scope for external-only engagement model.
- **Post-exploit / persistence / lateral** — Mimikatz/comsvcs LSASS dumping, golden/silver tickets, named-pipe impersonation, persistence (registry, scheduled tasks, WMI events, COM hijacking), token theft. These start after the perimeter has already broken — different bundle territory.
- **Evasion** — AMSI bypass, ETW patching, AV/EDR bypass. Tied to C2 tradecraft above.
- **iOS pentesting / hardware / RF / ICS** — out of scope by design.
- **Binary exploitation / kernel pwn / browser internals** — different skill universe.

If you're running an internal red team that includes domain-takeover chains via Kerberos or lateral movement, **this bundle won't help you in those phases** — and we'd rather say that up front than have you find out mid-engagement. The external surface handoff to internal-RT tooling (Impacket, NetExec, CrackMapExec, Rubeus, Certify, BloodHound) is intentionally outside our scope. **Coverage for internal AD and post-exploit may come in a future update.**

Full searchable catalog → **[docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md)**. Also ships **15 slash commands** (`/hunt`, `/recon`, `/report`, …) and a deterministic **engagement engine** (`engine/`) that maps a target's attack surface and routes each finding to the skill that handles it.

---

## How it works

A 6-phase, non-linear workflow — **recon → map & rank → hunt → validate → report** — with scope enforced in code and a **7-Question Gate** before anything is submitted. Two ways to drive it:

- **Plain English** — describe what you're testing and the relevant skill loads automatically.
- **`/hunt` scaffold + `cbh` CLI** — engagement-folder structure, state, and orchestration.

→ [Usage guide & worked example](USAGE.md) · [6-phase architecture & skill-to-phase map](docs/architecture.md) · [`cbh` CLI](docs/cbh-cli.md)

---
## Authorization

These skills are intended for assets you **own** or have **written authorization to assess** (bug-bounty in-scope assets, pentest engagement letters, CTF challenges, your own infrastructure).

The skills include validation gates that auto-trigger when you point Claude at unverified third-party targets — `triage-validation`'s 7-Question Gate explicitly asks whether the asset is in scope (Q3) and on the program's accepted-impact list (Q2). The `bugcrowd-reporting` skill includes researcher-side hygiene (Bugcrowdninja alias, account-state restoration, friendly-tester posture) that signals legitimate authorized testing to the target's fraud team.

The bundle explicitly **excludes**: weaponizing 0-days against unauthorized targets, post-exploitation tooling, malware development, mass-targeting infrastructure. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full posture.

> **Heads-up — Anthropic runtime cyber safeguards.** Anthropic's models apply real-time safeguards that **block "vulnerability exploitation or offensive security tooling development" by default** — so even *authorized, in-scope* work can hit a refusal that isn't this bundle's doing. If you do authorized offensive security (pentest / bug bounty / red team), enroll in Anthropic's **free, application-based [Cyber Verification Program (CVP)](https://claude.com/form/cyber-use-case)** to get safeguards adjusted for legitimate dual-use work. (Mass data exfiltration and ransomware development stay prohibited and are *not* adjustable.)

## Why this exists

Most bug-hunting Claude setups are either too generic (one big "security" prompt) or too fragmented (you bookmark 30 disclosed reports and re-read them every engagement). Neither scales past the second target.

This bundle was built and validated through authorized engagements that exposed different capability gaps:

**Bug-bounty engagement** — surfaced four gaps a starter 3-skill stack could not close:

1. **No hypothesis discipline** — drafts written before validation → wasted hours, hurt validity ratio
2. **No per-program reporting tactics** — VRT defaults auto-downgraded P3-worthy findings to P4
3. **No engagement coordination** — findings, evidence, and submission IDs scattered across folders
4. **No evidence hygiene** — screenshots leaked cookies and victim PII

**External red-team engagement** — exposed five additional gaps that bug-bounty defaults made worse:

1. **Conservative defaults retracted real findings** — WAPT mindset stopped tests early on defended targets where red-team continuation would have surfaced bypass chains → `redteam-mindset`
2. **No mid-engagement situational awareness** — client SOC patched confirmed SQLi within 30 min; external attacker locked 14 accounts during a live test session — both invisible without explicit detection methodology → `mid-engagement-ir-detection`
3. **No enterprise-platform attack chains** — M365 + Entra ID, on-prem SharePoint, Cisco SSL VPN, vCenter, and 7 Android APKs all needed current 2024-2026 CVE knowledge and platform-specific tradecraft → `m365-entra-attack`, `okta-attack`, `hunt-sharepoint`, `hunt-aspnet`, `hunt-ntlm-info`, `vmware-vcenter-attack`, `enterprise-vpn-attack`, `apk-redteam-pipeline`
4. **No client-facing deliverable format** — bug-bounty report templates don't fit enterprise red-team where output is a 50KB+ MD + DOCX with embedded screenshots → `redteam-report-template`
5. **No post-credential escalation model** — when recon yielded credentials (AWS keys, JWTs, GCP JSON), it was unclear what they granted or how to escalate → `cloud-iam-deep`

The per-class `hunt-*` skills address gap-zero (*"what should I look for in webapps"*) — the original 24 codifying patterns from 681 disclosed HackerOne reports, with 20+ framework/surface skills added by the community v3 expansion — Claude knows the actual chain templates real triagers paid for, not abstract OWASP Top 10. The enterprise-platform and red-team-tradecraft layers address what bug-bounty alone cannot: external red-team engagements against monitored enterprise targets.
